# Factoring the Difference of Two Squares

A web-based flashcard app to practice factoring the difference of two
squares.\
Hosted at: [Factoring the Difference of Two
Squares](https://cityofsmiles.github.io/factoring-difference-of-two-squares)

## Overview

This interactive flashcard app helps learners practice factoring
expressions of the form:

    aÂ² - bÂ² = (a + b)(a - b)

It provides randomized flashcard questions, instant feedback on answers,
and a results screen with an answer key.

## Features

-   **Randomized flashcards**: Each session loads a set of 10 randomly
    selected questions.\
-   **Instant feedback**: Get immediate feedback on whether your answer
    is correct or incorrect.\
-   **Answer key & score**: View your final score and compare your
    answers with the correct factored forms.\
-   **Retry option**: Reload a new set of flashcards to keep
    practicing.\
-   **Smooth animations**: Built with Framer Motion for seamless
    transitions.

## Usage

1.  Visit the app:
    <https://cityofsmiles.github.io/factoring-difference-of-two-squares>\
2.  A flashcard will appear with a difference of squares expression.\
3.  Type the factored form in the input box (e.g., `(x + 9)(x - 9)`).\
4.  Navigate between cards using **Previous** and **Next**.\
5.  Submit your answers to see your score and the full answer key.

## Development

This project is built with **React** and **Framer Motion**.
